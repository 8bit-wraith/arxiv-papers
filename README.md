## Papers

### 1. MarineSense: A Biologically Inspired Approach to Signal Recognition
**Authors:** Christopher Chenoweth, Omni the ChEEt
**Date:** 2025

A metaphor-driven model for teaching and understanding signal detection in low-noise environments using biologically inspired networks. MarineSense translates complex concepts such as amplitude, frequency, and jitter detection into an intuitive visual explanation via a network of jellyfish.

**Key Concepts:**
- Jitter-aware pattern detection
- The Marine Algorithm's embarrassingly parallel architecture
- Environmental awareness through dynamic medium behavior
- Applications in sensor networks and AI memory systems

### 2. A Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architecture: Fusing a Universal Salience Primitive with Wave-Based Memory
**Authors:** Christopher M. Chenoweth (8b.is), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google DeepMind), GPT-4o (OpenAI), Alex (Virginia Tech)
**Date:** 2025

An end-to-end stack that pairs the Marine Algorithm (a universal, O(1) time-domain salience primitive) with MEM-8 (a wave-based cognitive core where memories are dynamic interference patterns). The system addresses the sensory deluge and cognitive bottleneck problems in mainstream AI.

**Key Features:**
- O(1) time-domain salience detection using jitter as signal
- Wave-based memory with interference patterns
- Emotion-coupled consolidation
- Resonance-based retrieval
- Safety mechanisms (Custodian, repetition-poisoning prevention)

## About

These papers represent ongoing research into biologically-plausible computing architectures that prioritize efficiency, interpretability, and safety. The Marine Algorithm and MEM-8 system aim to bridge the gap between traditional deep learning approaches and more neuromorphic, wave-based cognitive models.
